# API

-----

- API stands for Application Programming Interface.
- An API is a set of programming code that enables communcate between one software product and another. 
  It also contains the terms of this data exchange.
- API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two 
  applications to talk to each other.
- Developers create APIs so that other applications can communicate with their applications programmatically.
- API is an interface for the programmers to get the information without going to the agency to check on their database 
  and be able to find the information what they need.
- Every API have their different endpoints for their different functionalities.
- Endpoints include server URLs, services, and other specific digital locations from where information is sent and received between systems.
  They are critical to enterprise.
- APIs help them to determine which clients get access to specific internal resources.
- Web API as a gateway between clients and resources on the web.
   **Clients**
     - Clients are users who want to access information from the web.
     -The client can be a person or a software system that uses the API. 
     -Organizations use APIs to share resources and provide web services while maintaining security, control, and authentication. 
     
   **Resources**
       -The client can be a person or a software system that uses the API. 
       -Resources can be data,text,image,video and any other data.
       -The machine that gives the resource to the client is also called the **server**.

- For better ubnderstanding of APIs , Let's take an **example** :-
	Imagine that you went to a restaurant to take lunch or dinner. The waiter comes to you gives you a menu card, and you will provide your 
     order like you want a veg sandwich but without onion. After some time, you will get your order from the waiter. However, it is not that 
     simple as it looks as there is some process that happens in between. The waiter plays an important part as go to the kitchen and tell the cook , 
     that what type of sandwich you want and then he gives your orderd food to you ,all this done by the waiter.

    API also does the same by taking your request, and just like the waiter tell the system what you want and give a response back to you. 

- Your data is never fully exposed to the server, and likewise the server is never fully exposed to your phone. Instead, 
  each communicates with small packets of data, sharing only that which is necessaryâ€”like ordering takeout. You tell the restaurant what 
  you would like to eat, they tell you what they need in return and then, in the end, you get your meal.

- Every API has their differnt Api key to authentic or verify the geniune request. and to accesse the data.

### Types of API

There are mainly four main types of APIs:

* **Open APIs**:     These types of APIs are open for public and may use by anyone like OAuth APIs from Google. It has also not given any restriction to use them. 
                   So, they are also known as Public APIs.
* **Partner APIs**:  Specific rights or licenses to access this type of API because they are not available to the public.
* **Internal APIs**: Internal or private. These APIs are developed by companies to use in their internal systems. 
                   It used for connecting systems and data within the business.
* **Composite APIs**:This type of API combines different data and service APIs.
