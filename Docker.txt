- Docker uses local cache memory to store containers.

- Orchestrator allow us to manage scale monitor the container.that we Can run on our servers.

- when Docker Fails try to restart it.

- Yaml is used in docker & Kubernatives.

* Docker Compose
- Docker Compose Define & run multi-containers applications
- It is define using YAMML Files.
- Docker run using the docker CLI with the compose plugin  
- docker Compose is use for that don't have high workloads or require a full orchestrator like Kubernatives.
- It perfect when developing & testing locally before deploying to kubernatives.
- you can use many cloud services in docker compose. 
- you can define the power consumption of cpu and memory allocation in docker compose and also limit it.
- You can set a environment variable

* Container Registries 
- Central repositories for container images
- It can be Private or Public
- docker pull the images from this repo from Docker hub and store it in cache.
- you can pull and push your image into repo in Docker hub it's just like Github.

* Kubernetes
-Service discovery & load balancing of containers.
-storage Orchestration , Local & Cloud based.
-automated rollouts |& rollbacks 
-it manage the health of containers.
-it manages the secret and Configurations of the containers.
It use the same api across on-premise and every cloud providers.
-It don't reply the source code 
-It does not build your application
-It doesn't provide application level services like message buses,databases,caches,etc.

* Layer Caching 

-In docker File ever you write is a layer itself.
-so at the very first stage docker store it's layer into cache. 
-so when you run that docker container another time so it runs fast because at that time it doesn't have to install all layer again.
- so please define your layer carefully,it related your container speed.
- In docker when you changes in just one layer , so docker download all layers again from that changed layer.
suppose there are total 10 layers and you take changed in 7th layer , so it download all layers from the 7th layer.
