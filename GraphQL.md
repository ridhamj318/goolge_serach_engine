-GraphQL is developed by **Facebook** and it's a **OpenSourse Query Language**
-It went public in 2015.
-GraphQL stands for **Graph Query Language**. 
**Graph** represents the relationships between the various pieces of data that we have and the entities (e.g. “Book” and “Author”).
***But in a GraphQL the Graph Datbase has nothing to do with the GraphQL , they both are different just like Java and Javascript***
-In the word GraphQL , Graph means that our queries are now able to crawl in the REST API and pickup the selective information.
-GraphQL is a query language and server-side runtime for application programming interfaces (APIs) that prioritizes giving clients exactly
 the data they request and no more.
-GraphQL also helps the companies to **reduce** the **cost of server**. 
-GraphQL actually is a language for writing **standardized data queries**.
-It enables developers to ask for exactly what is needed and get back predictable results.   
-GraphQL is designed to make APIs** fast, flexible, and developer-friendly.**
-It can even be deployed within an integrated development environment (IDE) known as GraphiQL. 
- It also makes it possible to access many sources in a **single request**, reducing the number of network calls and bandwidth requirements, 
 therefore saving battery life and CPU cycles consumed by applications. 
-GraphQL can be used to build modern web and mobile applications faster by simplifying data management.
-GraphQL allows you to request and receive just the data you need, when you need it.
-It solves the probem of **Over Fetching and under fetching** and reduce the load on servers and improves performance.
-Unlike REST API, GraphQL has only **one endpoint** for data.
-In GraphQL we have **Playground** to test our API.
-In GraphQL,we use **Query** to get data.
			 **Mutation** To post/update/delet our data.
			 **Resolver** has the logic to handle Query and Mutation.
-GraphQL enables you to drastically **reduce the number of endpoints** required to manage your application data needs.
-GraphQL allows you to change your data types and structure without impacting existing queries or backend schemas.
- You can easily **add new fields and types** to an existing API without changing your front-end code or creating new versions of your API. 
-GraphQL is not tied to any specific database engine, platform, or codebase so you to use it in many scenarios.
-GraphQL makes building applications that rely on **real-time data**, like social media or chat
