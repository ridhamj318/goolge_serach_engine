### Programming Paradigm

-------

- The term Programming Paradigm refers to a style of programming.
- Paradigm can also be termed as method to solve some problem or do some task.
- There are lots of programming languages that are well-known but all of them 
 need to follow some strategy when they are implemented. And that strategy is a paradigm.
- Programming paradigm helps to reduce the complexity of the code.
- It is an approach to solve problems.

## Types Of Programming Paradigm

### Imperative programming paradigm: 
--------

- The word "imperative" comes from the Latin "impero" meaning "I command".
- It is one of the oldest programming paradigm.
- It is based on Von Neumann architecture.
- This paradigm consists of several statements, and after the execution of all of them, the result is stored. 
- Itâ€™s about writing a list of instructions to tell the computer what to do step by step.

**Procedural programming paradigm**

- There is no difference in between procedural and imperative approach.
- It features close to machine architecture.
- Languages that support the procedural programming paradigm are:
 C,C++,Java,ColdFusion,Pascal.

**Object-oriented programming paradigm**

- The program is written as a collection of classes and object which are meant for communication in prder to 
 perform task.
- It can handle almost all kind of real life problems which are today in scenario.
- There is a lot of code that could be shared and reused.
- Languages that support the object-oriented paradigm:
 Python,Ruby,Java,C++,Smalltalk.

**Parallel processing approach**

- Parallel processing is the processing of program instructions by dividing them among multiple processors.
- A parallel processing system posses many numbers of processor with the objective of running a program in 
 less time by dividing them.
- It speeds up performance.
- Languages that support the Parallel processing approach:
 NESL (one of the oldest ones),C,C++.

### Declarative programming paradigm

- Declarative programming is a programming paradigm in which the programmer defines what needs to be accomplished
 by the program instead of instructing how to achieve it.
- It just declares the result we want rather how it has be produced. 
- *** This is the only difference between imperative (how to do) and declarative (what to do) programming paradigms.***

**Logic programming paradigms**

- The logic programming paradigm takes a declarative approach to problem-solving. It's based on formal logic.
- It would solve logical problems like puzzles, series etc.
- The logic programming paradigm made up of facts and clauses.
- It uses everything it knows and tries to solve the problem.
-Languages that support the logic programming paradigm:
 Prolog,Absys,ALF (algebraic logic functional programming language),Alice,Ciao.

**Functional programming paradigm**

- The functional programming paradigm has its roots in mathematics and it is language independent. 
- The key principle of this paradigm is the execution of a series of mathematical functions.
- Function can be replaced with their values without changing the meaning of the program.
- Languages that support functional programming paradigm:
 Haskell,OCaml,Scala,Clojure,Racket,JavaScript.

**Database processing approach**

- This programming methodology is based on data and its movemvent.
- Program statements are defined by data rather than hard-coding a series of steps.
- A database program is the heart of a business information system.
- A good database processing approach is crucial to any company or organization. 
 This is because the database stores all the pertinent details about the company such as employee records,etc.
- There are several programming languages that are developed mostly for database application. For example SQL.
